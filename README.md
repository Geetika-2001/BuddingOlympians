POSE DETECTION
The tools used to do pose detection :
We used the new Person Detection feature of the Google CloudÂ Video Intelligence API.
The REST API enables users to annotate videos stored locally or in Cloud Storage with contextual information at the level of the entire video, per segment, per shot, and per frame. 
The Video Intelligence API offers Person Detection which detects each person in the video and recognizes a large amount of body parts, facial features, and clothing Using Person Detection in this lab, you will be able to calculate the position of a tennis player's wrists, knees, elbows, and shoulders over time from a video clip. 


Computing the Speed of My Serve
Pose detection let us compute the angles of the body, to compute the speed of the ball after hitting it with my racket. 
Auto ML Vision lets you upload your own labeled data (i.e. with labeled tennis balls) and trains a model for you.
With an Auto ML Vision Object Detection model that's been trained to recognize tennis balls, we will be able to track the position of the ball in the same video and determine its speed. 
This collective data can then be analyzed to determine many aspects about the tennis serve such as when the serve happened, how powerful the serve was, and what the tennis player's form during the serve was.
